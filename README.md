# HashCodePizza :pizza:

This is a solution for the practice problem statement google hashcode has announced.

#Score

This algorithm has a score of 79-80% (800.000)

#Idea

The idea was really simple. First, we find a random cell and the we try to fit in a random shape.
Then we continue doing it again and again X times. As you can see Randomness doesn't give us the best
solution but it's not that bad!

#Time
If you use a X = 50.000.000, it will take around 15 seconds for the big dataset.
